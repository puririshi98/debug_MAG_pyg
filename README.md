# debug_MAG_pyg
mag_repro.py contains the code from our internal repo which is used for the MAG end to end workflow

A large portion of the code is irrelevant to the bug. I am able to reproduce the bug with a much simpler trainer class and the same models, and FakeHeteroDataset.

See synthetic_repro.py
